dcm4che has jar files and i want to use this storescu command from it. 
Here is a link to it https://github.com/dcm4che/dcm4che/blob/master/dcm4che-tool/dcm4che-tool-storescu/README.md 

import subprocess

def send_dicom_using_dcm4che(file_path, host, port, aet):
    cmd = [
        "java", "-jar", "path/to/dcm4che/lib/storescu.jar",
        "-c", f"{aet}@{host}:{port}",
        file_path
    ]
    return subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)
