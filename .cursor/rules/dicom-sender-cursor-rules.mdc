# Release rules
When I ask for a new release:
1. Increment the version number in src/__init__.py
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with the changes
3. Create a new tag in GitHub with that version number
4. Build the application with PyInstaller using the exact command in docs/release_process.md
5. Create a ZIP file in the releases directory following the naming convention Alexamon_DICOM_Sender_vX.Y.Z.zip

The process must follow all steps documented in docs/release_process.md - this is mandatory for all releases.
